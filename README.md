# Star-Wars-Interactions
This project aims to better understand networks in the Star Wars universe by looking into data with information about interactions between 110 characters across various films.

Using the Star Wars Network Data found here: https://github.com/evelinag/star-wars-network-data/blob/master/starwars-full-interactions.json. Wrote a function to unpack the JSON data and split into nodes and links table in the Starwars_Function file. Manually filled in additional information about characters into the nodes table using the https://www.starwars.com/databank website, then cleaned data by assigning a value of 'Other' when there are a low number of observations with a certain value through the CleanGephiNodes file. Finally, performed network analysis of the Star Wars universe using the Gephi software and provided an analysis of our findings in the Final_Report file.
